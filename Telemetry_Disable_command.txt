We track general usage information, such as Next.js plugins and build performance. Specifically, we track the following anonymously:

Command invoked (next build, next dev, or next export)
Version of Next.js
General machine information (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux, whether or not the command was run within CI)
What Next.js plugins are present in your project
Duration of next build and size of application (total number of pages)
Note: This list is regularly audited to ensure its accuracy.

You can view exactly what is being collected by setting the following environment variable: NEXT_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1.

When this environment variable is set, data will not be sent to us. The data will only be printed out to the stderr stream, prefixed with [telemetry].
